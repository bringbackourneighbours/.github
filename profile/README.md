# Bring Back Our Neighbors
After the successful fight for the return of the I. family to Pirna, a Saxony-wide alliance has come together. In several round tables, people from politics, churches, associations and initiatives discussed how those affected can be supported and how we can stand together in solidarity against Saxonyâ€™s deportation policy.

We are developing comprehensive and multilingual information material on protection against deportations. We have developed 9 flyers with short information from asylum procedures to deportation and 3 emergency cases against deportations. This information is for those affected and supporters who are critical of certain or all deportations.

Deportations often happen in secret. Most people do not know when deportations are imminent, how violent deportations are and what the fear of deportation means. Often people are affected who, with better counselling, which the authorities unfortunately usually do not provide, would have a good chance of getting the right to stay. That is why you will find basic information on deportations and how to avoid them on this website, partly in several languages: Digital and to print out and distribute.
